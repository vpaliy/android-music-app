Simplified version of Melophile. 

This is a simple music app which is based on Melophile. 
This app doesn't require authentication. You just get in, search for music, and listen to it.

# What can I do with it? #
- stream music
- like/dislike a song
- search 
- invite friends (thanks to `Firebase Invites`)
- browse your listening history
- browse your favorite songs.

It doesn't contain ads. And it never will.
